Fibonacci
=========
The Fibonacci Sequence is a set of numbers formed as follows: the first and
second terms are both 1 and each succeeding term is formed by adding the two
preceding terms. So the sequence starts 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, â€¦
Write a program that displays the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. Your program will
calculate the sequence in a method and return the result in an array.
Enhance your program by prompting the user for the number
of terms (you must decide on a reasonable maximum).
